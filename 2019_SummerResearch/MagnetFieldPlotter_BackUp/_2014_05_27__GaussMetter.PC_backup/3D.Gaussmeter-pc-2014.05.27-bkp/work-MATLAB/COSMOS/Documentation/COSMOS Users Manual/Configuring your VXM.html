<P>I.) Setting up your system for the 1<SUP>st</SUP> time</P>
<OL TYPE=I>
	<P>The 1<SUP>st</SUP> time that COSMOS is run (typically immediately
	after install), COSMOS will detect the port and settings to
	correctly communicate with the VXM. 
	</P>
	<P>In order for this option to correctly establish communications,
	the VXM must be connected and turned on.</P>
	<P>If the VXM is not connected and powered up at the time COSMOS is
	scanning, then you can abort the scan and start over by selecting
	&ldquo;Tools--&gt;Wizard&rdquo;, and the software will again attempt
	to assist in the setting up of your system.</P>
