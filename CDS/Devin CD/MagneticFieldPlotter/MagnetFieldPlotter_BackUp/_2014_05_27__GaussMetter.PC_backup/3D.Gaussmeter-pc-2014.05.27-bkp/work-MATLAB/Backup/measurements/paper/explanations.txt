GROUSE_II_new_pole_XY_4x2.mat: 

linear gradient grouse with new 1006 steel pole piece.
XY plot in with the normal convention. 201 X-steps over 4 cm, 101 Y-steps over 2 cm
Center is at XZ-origin (centered over magnet), minumum Y-value is with probe tip
1.8mm below the plane of the pole piece surface (where the sensor is) 

GROUSE_II_new_pole_ZY_3x2.mat:

As above, ZY plane, 151 Z-steps over 3 cm, 101 Y-steps over 2 cm. Centered about the magnet 
center, Y=0 is with probe tip 1.8mm below pole face


ZX: probe sensitive spot where 2nd derivative of field is zero. This occurs about 0.35 cm
from the magnet face. Measurement was 3 cm x 3 cm, 101 x 10 pts. (i'm not sure about the .35)

GROUSE III measurements: probe is positioned in Y-direction with tip ~1mm from large
pole surface

ZY: 501 Z-points, 251 Y-points, 20cm x 5 cm. Z-channel is always multiplied by 1000, so is wrong half the time
X- channel is left unmultiplied and will need to be corrected. Started 8 pm

XY: 401 X-points, 251 Y-points, 8 cm x 5 cm. Same corrections as above needed. Started 7 AM

GROUSE II, Older pole

exact same measurements as for new pole
the 2nd derivative is zero at about 0.6 cm from the surface, so that's where the XZ measurement
is.

Really, the y-minimum is probably below zero because the probe tip was 1.8mm below the 
surface, not the middle of the spot. an offset of half the proble sensitive z-thickness should
be added.

GROUSE III, no poles

ZY: started with probe tip 8.2mm from magnet surface. 20cm Z by 8 cm Y, 501 x 401 points
started 4:50 pm Dec 31. Crashed some time in the afternoon on Jan 1. restarted 9:27pm

Have to do it in two parts: ZY1 - 8.2mm to 48.2mm 501x 201 pts
			    ZY2 = 48.2mm + sz to 88.2mm 501 x 200 pts

Crashed on 2nd part. Restarted, ~48.2mm + sz, doing 50 z points, 1-sz cm
